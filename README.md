# Starfinder Populator
Populate your Starfinder world with life of all shapes and sizes.

## Features:
- Generates non-combatant NPCs for your world
- Randomizes the name, gender, race, alignment and inventory of the NPC
- Intelligently randomizes the token image of NPCs when placed in a scene (optional setting, *off* by default)

## FAQ:
*Q: Does Populator just pick a random race when quickly making an NPC?*

**A: No I follow the distribution of races found on Absalom Station.  As of `0.1.X` you can create an NPC of your specific desired race.

*Q: What races does populator currently support?*

**A: Android, Dwarf, Drow, Gnome, Gnoll, Half-Elf, Half-Orc, Halfling, Human, Hobgoblin, Kasatha, Lashunta, Nuar, Skittermander, Shirren, Vesk, Ysoki**

*Q: So how do you pick attribute and skill modifiers?*

**All values come directly from the process outlined in the Alien Archive (Non-combatant NPCs use the expert array with a creature type and optionally a creature subtype graft applied)**

*Q: How do I setup my folder structure for dynamic token images?*

**Extract `example folder structure.zip` into your data folder and fill in the appropriate folders with images (Please be aware this feature is experimental and subject to change).**

*Q: Why doesn't populator generate monsters though!?*

**A: ~~Because that's hard and I haven't done it yet~~ Work is underway, you can experiment with what's currently live to create basic monsters starting in  release `0.1.X` **

*Q: This would be way better if it did this other specific thing!*

**A: That's not a question. Please open an issue as I'm currently focusing on things that are useful to me personally and would love the input.**

*If you'd like to support the work I do on the Starfinder system or modules please buy me a coffee*
